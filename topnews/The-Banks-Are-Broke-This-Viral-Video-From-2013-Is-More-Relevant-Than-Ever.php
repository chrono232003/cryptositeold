   A video from 2013 depicting a European ministers tirade against the global banking system has recently re-emerged and gone viral. Gaining massive traction within the crypto community, the speech is now more relevant than ever  and central banks know it.
  </p>
  <h2>
   All the Banks Are Broke
  </h2>
  <p>
   Within an impassioned speech, British politician and former member of European Parliament (MEP) Godfrey Bloom thoroughly dismantles the global banking sector, proposing that banks are broke and highlighting what he calls institutional incompetence and chicanery.
  </p>

  </p>
  <p>
   Packing in as much vitriol as one can within a two minutes, Bloom systematically tears the financial system apart.
  </p>
  <p>
   Aiming at the sectors penchant for fractional reserve banking, the former-MEP remarks that banks lending money that they dont actually have is tantamount to a criminal scandal.

   Financial institutions around the world have been operating fractional reserve systems for many years. The practice entails using the vast majority of customer deposits to generate profit via interest rates on loans. This results in a mere fraction of bank deposits (10% for larger institutions) remaining available for withdrawal.
  </p>
  <p>
   Bloom also focused on the moral hazard within banking, alluding that the governments promise to bail out banksas they have done time and time againencourages riskier behavior.

   Most pertinent of all was Blooms take on quantitative easing (QE):
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    We have counterfeiting, sometimes called quantitative easing, but counterfeiting by any other namethe artificial printing of moneywhich, if any ordinary person did, theyd go to prison for a very long time, and yet governments and central banks do it all the time.
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <h2>
   Quantitative Easing Cant Last Forever
  </h2>
  <p>
   In the decade since the financial crisis, the worlds central banks have combated rising interest rates by buying copious quantities of government debtaka QE.

   In 2019 following a dovish turn from the U.S. Federal Reserve, global economies started upping their fiscal policy games. Among the more unconventional monetary maneuvers was QE.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 2019, the
   <a data-wpel-link="internal" href="https://www.ccn.com/the-fed-just-blew-the-lid-on-the-next-financial-crisis/" rel="noopener" target="_self">
    Feds repo operations offered a veneered return to QE
   </a>
   . Meanwhile, the European Central Bank (ECB) didnt even bother with the charade, announcing in September that it would start up QE once again,
   <a data-wpel-link="exclude" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/isabeltogoh/2019/09/12/what-to-expect-from-the-european-central-bank-decision/#38a4ab953df9" rel="follow noopener" target="_self">
    buying up bonds
   </a>
   at a rate of 20 billion for as long as necessary.
  </p>
  <p>
   While QE proved to quell the last financial crisis, the artificial printing of money  to quote Bloom  isnt sustainable.

   Worryingly, speaking before the Senate Banking Committee last week, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell commented that the Fed

   </a>
   aggressively should another recession hit.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    It is much more likely we will have to turn to the tools we used in the financial crisis [] I believe we will use them aggressively should the need arise to do so. There is no need to do that now but we will use those tools aggressively.

   The problem is, many economistsas well as the World Economic Forum (WEF)have noted that QE may not be as effective as it was last time. According to its 2019 annual

   Now, central banks are starting to sweat.
  </p>
  <p>
   To keep the threat of crypto at bay, many institutions accept that its time to overhaul the antiquated financial system via central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).

   collective to the Peoples Bank of Chinas incipient CBDC, central banks all over the globe are hurrying to either implement a digital currency or actively research them.
  </p>
  <p>
   The topic of CBDCs was even broached by Powell
   <a data-wpel-link="internal" href="https://www.ccn.com/bitcoin-price-soars-jerome-powell-confirms-cryptos-threat-to-dollar/" rel="noopener" target="_self">
    during a congressional hearing

   last week.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    Every major central bank is currently taking a deep look, Powell said, We feel thats our obligation, technology has now made that possible. I think its very much incumbent on us and other central banks to understand the costs and benefits and tradeoffs associated with a possible digital currency.
   </p>

  <p>
   The pressure to compete with China, combined with private sector initiatives such as bitcoin and Facebooks Libra, its do or die time for the U.S. and Wall Street.
