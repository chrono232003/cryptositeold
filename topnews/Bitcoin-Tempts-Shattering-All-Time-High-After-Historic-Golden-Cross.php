   The good news for the bulls is that history is on their side. There have been crucial developments over the last few weeks indicating that bitcoin may skyrocket above $20,000 before 2020 expires.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Golden Cross Indicates a Strong Bull Run on the Horizon
  </h2>
  <p>
   The golden cross is a reliable technical indicator signaling a strong bull rally. This happens when the 50-DMA crosses above the 200-DMA.
  </p>
  <p>
   Since 2012, the golden cross only happened three times for bitcoin. The first one was in October 2015. The cross marked the beginning of a strong bull market that saw the top cryptocurrency meteorically rise from $300 to nearly $20,000. Thats a massive gain of over 6,560% in two years.
  </p>
  <p>
   The second time it happened,
   <a data-wpel-link="internal" href="https://www.ccn.com/bitcoin-price-races-toward-wildly-bullish-golden-cross/" rel="noopener" target="_self">
    bitcoin soared from $5,000 in April 2019
   </a>
   to nearly $14,000 in June 2019. Thats a 180% gain in less than 60 days.

  <p>
   History tells us that the dominant cryptocurrency may rise between 180% and 6,560% after a golden cross. Even if we take the low end of that wide range, its possible for bitcoin to climb to $27,000.
  </p>
  <p>
   The timing couldnt be more ideal. Its important to note that the

   in about 82 days. This will decrease miner selling pressure from

    1,800 BTC to 900 BTC per day
   </a>
   . With supply dwindling as bulls gain momentum, its not difficult to imagine that bitcoins value may skyrocket.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Bitcoin Tends to Soar After Climbing Above the 200-Day Moving Average
  </h2>
  <p>
   Many retail investors are focused on day-to-day price fluctuations that they tend to overlook bigger developments. On Jan. 28, bitcoin broke above the 200-day moving average (DMA). To many technical analysts, this is a strong signal that the trend has shifted from bearish to bullish. However, it goes way beyond that.

    Fundstrat founder Tom Lee
   </a>
   says that the cryptocurrency has a history of skyrocketing within six months after moving above the 200-DMA. He said,
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    When bitcoin breaks above its 200-day, which it did about two weeks ago, its average six-month gain is about 190 percent.
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
   Based on that stat alone, bitcoin may ascend to $26,000 by the end of June. The prediction appears to be aligned with bitcoins lowest possible gain after a golden cross.

   I spoke to analysts and they are not discounting the fact that bitcoin may print a new all-time high this year. Trader Max believes it is certainly possible. He told CCN,
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    I think we will post a new all-time high or at least get very close to it.
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
   Mati Greenspan, founder of Quantum Economics, chimed in. He said,
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    One of bitcoins unique characteristics is its ability to make these meteoric rises. Its not something Im counting on but definitely wouldnt be too surprised if it happens.
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
   History appears to be on the side of bitcoin. If thats truly the case, the $20,000 resistance will be history.
  </p>
  <h2>
   The Bear Case: Bitcoin Trades in a Wide Range Without Posting New High
  </h2>
  <p>
   Even with all the signals pointing to another strong year for bitcoin, its also possible that the cryptocurrency trades in a wide range for most of 2020.
  </p>
  <p>
   Looking at the chart of BTC/USD, theres a lot of real-estate between $12,000 and $19,000. While this suggests a lack of resistance, it could also indicate the absence of a base. Without a solid base, it would be difficult for BTC to sustain its ascent.

  <p>
   Its quite possible for bitcoin to just trade between $12,000 and $19,000 for the majority of 2020. This would be a tall order for the bears considering that bitcoin tends to get media attention when it is surging. Nevertheless, they have a window to slow bitcoins ascent and keep the top cryptocurrency from printing new highs this year.
