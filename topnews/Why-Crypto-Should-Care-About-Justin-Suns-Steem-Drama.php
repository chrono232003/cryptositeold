   Justin Sun has seized control of the Steem blockchain  with the apparent help of several prominent crypto exchanges.
  </p>
 </div>
 <div class="article-pharagraph" id="node-1">
  <p class="text">
   On the Steemit Blog (which is newly owned by Sun),
   <a data-reactroot="" href="https://steemit.com/tron/@steemitblog/an-open-letter-to-the-community-hf22-5" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
    a post

   announced the new regime:
  </p>
 </div>
 <div class="article-pharagraph" id="node-2">
  <p class="text">
   "For the next 4-6 weeks, the Steemit team will be using the voting rights to resume the order of the community while having an open channel for meeting community members and Witnesses."
  </p>
 </div>
 <div class="article-pharagraph" id="node-3">
  <p class="text">
   However, as of this writing, users are telling us of app instability and users on Steemit are signaling outright revolt. This is
   <a data-reactroot="" href="http://archive.is/Qmdei" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
    an archived version
   </a>
   of the original post because Steemit has been unstable.

 </div>
 <div class="article-pharagraph" id="node-4">
  <p class="text">
   In a delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) system such as Steem, this Orwellian update is only made possible by enough of the networks native currency, STEEM, being thrown behind a new set of blockchain validators.
  </p>
 </div>
 <div class="article-pharagraph" id="node-5">
  <p class="text">
   In short, exchanges have staked STEEM they controlled (seemingly from user accounts) to vote for new leadership.
  </p>
 </div>
 <div class="article-pharagraph" id="node-6">
  <p class="text">
   The implications reach much further than just Steem or Tron, underlining the fundamental message of the "
   <a data-reactroot="" href="/upbit-is-the-sixth-major-crypto-exchange-hack-of-2019">
    not your keys, not your crypto
   </a>
   " mantra. When users hold large amounts of their assets on exchanges, it gives those firms potentially decisive power over ostensibly decentralized networks, particularly when governance authority is tied to currency holdings.

   The turmoil began on Feb. 14 when it was announced Sun, the controversial founder of the Tron blockchain, had acquired Steemit, a blogging site that owns a very large quantity of the STEEM cryptocurrency.
  </p>
 </div>
 <div class="article-pharagraph" id="node-9">
  <p class="text">
   In response, STEEM community leaders, the validators of the blockchain,
   <a data-reactroot="" href="/justin-sun-bought-steemit-steem-moved-to-limit-his-power">
    initiated a soft fork on Feb. 23
   </a>
   that censored the stake of tokens held by Steemit, usually referred to in the community as the "ninja-mined stake," as CoinDesk previously reported.

   "It's like the rich guys getting together and saying 'let's show them who's the real boss,'" Roeland Lanparty, a pseudonymous Dutch citizen who runs a Steem witness and some major applications, told CoinDesk over a WhatsApp call.

 </div>
 <div class="article-pharagraph" id="node-11">

   Leaders or validators on Steem are called witnesses, serving similar roles to bitcoin's miners. All 20 of the new witnesses now leading the chain are accounts created in February 2020.

   "I was made aware of this upgrade/hardfork beforehand, and approved it. Projects do this all the time, and we are usually just in a supportive position," he wrote. "Just messaged @justinsuntron, no response yet. Assume he will respond publicly soon."

   The prior group of witnesses has begun signalling for an alternate software, 22.4444, in protest. The multiple fours are meant to have negative connotations, as "4" is not seen as a lucky number in China. Users have also been posting giant images of the numeral 4 in threads on Steemit.

   The community could still move to hard fork. If they did so, no doubt Steemit would continue to point to the current chain, 22.5, now controlled by Tron allies, but others might not. There are hundreds of apps built on Steem, including alternative blogging front-ends that could start reading a new chain rather than the one controlled by Tron.
  </p>
 </div>
 <div class="article-pharagraph" id="node-35">

   Blogging alternatives on Steem include

   On balance, Lanparty said, leaders are keeping apps live in order to not silence the community. However, he pulled an app he had built,
   <a data-reactroot="" href="https://steemwallet.app/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
    SteemWallet

   , from the iOS and Android app stores in protest.

   "This is a larger discussion and potentially historical moment for blockchains," Stokes told CoinDesk. "The mechanisms we use to protect these byzantine-fault-tolerant systems, how secure are they really? This is being tested right now."
  </p>
 </div>
 <div class="article-pharagraph" id="node-39">
  <p class="text">
   Somewhat ironically, Lanparty said part of the reason why it soft-forked rather than hard-forked was out of deference to the exchanges. A hard fork would have required exchanges to run new code so their users could withdraw tokens, and the witnesses making the change felt this would be unfair to users.
  </p>
 </div>
 <div class="article-pharagraph" id="node-40">
  <p class="text">
   However, until the Steem software is changed, tokens will be locked up for much longer. Once tokens are locked up to vote, it is designed to take 13 weeks to "power down" (in Steem parlance) and make them exchangeable again. (Of course, the new slate of witnesses now have the power to simply shorten this window.)
