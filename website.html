<p>Hello Adam,</p>

<p>Thank you for purchasing a Website Transfer! It's our pleasure to assist you with this process. Here's what you can expect:</p>

<h3><strong>Step 1: Complete the Website Transfer form</strong></h3>

<p>For us to begin transferring your website(s), we first need you to provide us the login credentials through our secure form. If you're unsure about any of the settings required in the form, please contact your previous hosting provider for answers. We are unable to contact your old host on your behalf. Here's the link to the form:</p>

<h3><strong>Step 2: We copy your data</strong></h3>

<p>We copy all files and databases associated with your domains. During the transfer, we ask that you please not close or make changes to your hosting accounts or website. Any changes made during transfer may not carry over. Your website and emails should remain live and functional throughout the migration process.</p>

<h3><strong>Step 3: Review and resolve</strong></h3>

<p>We execute basic visual and functional tests to confirm everything is working properly. In many cases we're able to provide a direct URL for you to test your site before taking it live. At this point, any changes needed should be communicated to us by replying to this email so they can be addressed quickly before enabling the site.</p>

<h3><strong>Step 4: Activating website</strong></h3>

<p>When it's time to take your website live, you'll have to change the name server settings for your domain. This must be done through the company where your domain is registered. (By this time we'll have sent you instructions on how to do this.) If you have any problems with this step, our Technical Support team will be happy to help.</p>

<p>We hope this helps you understand how the website migration process works. If you have any questions, you may reply to this email or contact our Technical Support team, who are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. http://help.bluehost.com</p>

Thank you,<br />
